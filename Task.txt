### Logic for Calculations
- Player Points = ((Batting Strike Rate / 5) + (Batting Average × 0.8)) + ((500 / Bowling Strike Rate) + (140 / Economy Rate))
- Batting Strike Rate = (Total Runs / Total Balls Faced) × 100
- Batting Average = Total Runs / Innings Played
- Bowling Strike Rate = Total Balls Bowled / Total Wickets Taken
- Economy Rate = (Total Runs Conceded / Total Balls Bowled) × 6
- Player Value (Rs.) = (9 × Points + 100) × 1000 (round to nearest 50,000)

### Special Notes
- Input all players from provided dataset (Google Drive link).
- Test CRUD with new players only (dataset unchanged).
- Create user account:
  - Username: spiritx_2025
  - Password: SpiritX@2025
